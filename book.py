1.  **You provide the vision:** A core topic, a detailed description, and a target language.
2.  **The Architect designs the blueprint:** An AI agent creates a detailed chapter-by-chapter outline in your chosen language.
3.  **The Researcher gathers the facts:** Another agent enriches the outline with data and details.
4.  **The Writer crafts the narrative:** A third agent writes the initial chapters with native-level fluency.
5.  **The Editor polishes the final product:** The final agent reviews and refines the text to publishing standards in the target language.

    Example for a biography:
    I want to write my life story. I was born in a small, poor village in Kenya. My family had very little, but we were happy. At 13, I became a devout Christian, which changed my life's direction. At 19, I got the opportunity to move to Germany as an au-pair. It was a huge culture shock, but I was determined. I managed to learn German, finish my studies, and get into university to study physics. After graduating, I transitioned into the tech world and became a successful Data Engineer. The book should focus on themes of faith, perseverance, and overcoming adversity.

    Example for a thematic book:
    I want to write a book about God's grace and forgiveness. It should be aimed at a modern Christian audience who may be struggling with these concepts. The book should explore what grace truly means, using biblical stories (like the Prodigal Son), theological insights (from writers like C.S. Lewis or Timothy Keller), and relatable modern-day anecdotes. It should be structured to help the reader move from understanding the concept to applying it in their own lives.
